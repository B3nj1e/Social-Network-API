## Description
A social network API using Express.js, NoSQL database; MongoDB and mongoose. This API allows the someone to get, create, update, and delete a user account. This API also allows the user to share their thoughts and react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. 

User story:
```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```
Acceptance Criteria:

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```


## Installation Instructions
To use the application, please download all associated files off the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/B3nj1e/Social-Network-API). Ensure node.js is installed. In the terminal run ``npm i`` to install the dependencies and packages. Once you have install the packages, run ``node index.js`` to start the server. Ensure you have Insomnia and MongoDBCompass installed. You will be able to use Insomnia to interact with the server to send and receive data to the database using MongoDB Compass. Using MongoDB Compass you will be able to see data in the tables under "socialNetworkDB" and using Insomina installed you will get able to run the GET, PUT, POST and DELETE HTTP requests to interact with stored data. Use localhost at PORT 3001 to access the routes. Use the POST route to enter you own data.

## Contribution Guidelines
If you think you can improve this application, please feel free to make contributions. I will review these changes on GitHub prior to merging them to the main branch.

## Test
To quickly test the application, follow the installation instructions above. To seed the database with some default data, navigate back to Insomnia and post your own data in the following format eg. User 
```json
{
  "username": "Ben",
  "email": "ben@gmail.com"
}
```
and thought below 
```json
{
  "thoughtText": "I love coding",
  "username": "Ben",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa23df4"
}
```

If you want to create new data use localhost with PORT 3001 in Insomnia, ensure you use POST route, to view use GET, to remove use DELETE and to update use PUT. Navigate to MongoDB Compass, if the seeding was successful you should have an "socialNetworkDB" database with data entries.
